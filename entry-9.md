# Entry 9

Today was a really great start off for the groups. well, for the group i'm in at least. although i generally believe that everyone is getting along with everyone else in the class, and if they aren't, i'm really not noticing it. everyone is working in a team to make the best possible website that they can make with their current skillset and i am very sure that we'll all be presenting live on facebook when presentation day comes. granted, my bus mall is finished but i could probably style it a bit better. but in all reality i probably won't due to the fact that i want to finish my salmon cookies project and get that resubmitted. i don't really have much hope of being able to complete the day 5 lab assignment because even at this point in time, i highly doubt i'd be able to make any more progress than has already been made.
