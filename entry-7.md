# Entry 7

All right, so today was quite a lot better than yesterday since i told myself i wasn't going to leave until i got the monday lab completed, which it is. and i got home by a decent time which is also great. today i think i found my calling: technical writing! i've always loved writing and people frequently ask me when i'm going to publish my works. well, i never really had the money to publish my own writing. so if i could get into technical writing somehow then that would be great! seriously! i could research topics all day and probably come up with some of the best material! okay, maybe that's aiming a little TOO high. but still, i think i would make one hell of a great technical writer. cause i love researching things if it doesn't relate to finding something for a coding project that i have no idea where to look or something like that. yeah.
