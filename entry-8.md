# Entry 8

Well, let's see how this goes since i'm currently riding on the bus. it'll be a little shaky but i can type all right when stopped at a light like right now. today's lab was refreshingly easy, although at first i wasn't sure about something so i talked it through with a TA and soon enough got it resolved. the view from the top of this double decker bus is quite great. anyhow... the whiteboarding session was nothing quite like i had ever done before. i was quite surprised that i kind of remembered how to write an object literal. i was just forgetting that make and model were supposed to be strings. the object constructor... well, sooner or later i would have thought of the syntax. but time was short and i'm pretty sure i spent the better portion of 3-4 minutes trying to remember how i started it. one of the best parts about today was creating my jeopardy-styled quiz. just hope i got it through that they answer with a question instead of a statement. oh yeah! i know what else. i completed the feature where the user only gets 24 guesses. that was good.
