Yo. Just sitting here in this chair trying to figure out what to put inside this for loop in order to make it do what i want it to do... i have a for loop for calculating the amount of cookies purchased at the store for each hour. My array for each hour in the day stores all of those. just need to think about the data structure i need to use for this loop. but i have temporary amnesia because i can't remember what i need to remember.
