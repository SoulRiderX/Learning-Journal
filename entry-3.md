# Entry 3

Well, today I finally fixed the error I've been getting with Michael's help. But now, this means I'm behind in the lab. I got all the times to show up underneath all of the store names. Except that really only two of them are working. Seattle Center is giving be a NaN error for the time, and the other two are undefined cookies. At this rate, I'm not going to finish the website on Friday. Not that I think this is hard, necessarily. It just takes me longer to think and to process what needs to be done.
